**PROPERTY REGISTRY ON BLOCKCHAIN PORTAL**

Registering information of property is very crucial to identify current and previous ownership. In absence of secure way to validate chain of ownership, same property can be fraudulently sold to multiple person. In a huge country like India, where registering and maintaining the property is a tedious task especially where the system is storing the information in centralized manner. We proposed the solution to the problems caused due to centralized data storage system such as fraudulency, corruption, lack of transparency in the system and immutable records.

1. Features :

*Introducing non-fungibility by tokenizing every property
*Ownership history
*Property Registry
*Search Property
*Property Details
*Change ownership request
*Current Owner Documents View
*Approve ownership request
*Monitor Blockchain activities
*Visualize property images (In case of land department - with google map)
*View ownership history
*Escrow Account for safe fund transfer

2. Features that are good to have :

*Insurance company integration.
*Data migration tool to assist property registry transfer from existing file systems into blockchain system.
*Loan Department could sanction loan to users to buy property.

3. Known Issues :

IPFS operability.
User will have to purchase token for the property.
User will have to pay a legitimate amount of currency for the property transfer.
* Implementation :
Our model verify and validate user data and provide secure mutual agreement in property Registry, with the use of multi node ethereum blockchain which provides impeccable security through its decentralized architecture and the multi node architecture which we have designed. Every ownership transaction such as change in ownership, create new property are being verified by proof of stack algorithm. Super admin verify admin who can validate new property by stating property value, property ID, Issue Date, property owner aadhar number and approve initial title transfer. Current owner can request change his/her ownership to new owner, which will be approved by both parties mutual agreement approval and dual random admin authentication. ERC721 token will be issued to property and transferred according to mutual agreement between new buyer and seller. Property's unique hash ID will be the basis of transaction in blockchain. Property ownership records and financial transaction will be saved on distributed network using IPFS protocol which could be referenced if requested, which will provide strong auditability for transaction with time-stamp. User can browse through ownership history of any property which ensures full transparency. Blockchain will ensure the validity in chain of ownership which will prohibit selling a particular property to multiple users, ownership history could be mapped for each property.

1. Architecture : Embedded .

2. Technology Stack :

 *Ethereum, Solidity, Truffle, MongoDB, NodeJS, Web 3.0, IPFS, Escrow API, ERC 721 token.

 *HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, AngularJS, Google Map API, Metamask, Ganache.
3. User interaction : For the user, Web Application is developed to implement all the above described functionalities.

* Application:
1. Easy Access -

It effectively and profitably drives socioeconomic development by enabling access to trusted digital records of ownership for property, delivered through distributed ledger and smart contract technologies

2. Transparent Tracking -

Tracking of property ownership through a distributed system which won't rely on trust of any third party.

3. Resolving Disputes -

Disputes such as division of land, authentication of property and the user itself Blockchain will resolve every such issue.

4. Preventing Frauds -

Blockchain will ensure the validity in chain of ownership which will prohibit selling a particular property to multiple users thus preventing frauds.

5. User Interaction -

User interface will enable users to browse through registered property (either land or vehicle or other properties), admin can validate new property (genesis) by stating - property value, property ID, Issue Date, property owner, property owner aadhar number Property owner can request a change in ownership. Relevant documents will be uploaded on secure distributed ledger by IPFS (Inter Planetary File System), respective property department admin (selected randomly) will validate the request and current owner will approve the ownership change request and this way property ownership will be changed.
